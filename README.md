# PythonScripts
The DataStructures.py file contains the following data structures with fully implemented functions, and test blocks at the end of the file:
    -DLink (creates arcs/edges/links between nodes)
    -Node (creates nodes/verticies)
    -Stack (standard LIFO stack)
    -FifoQueue (standard FIFO queue)
    -MinHeap (minimum heap class. uses an alternate implementation without the use of a decrease key function)
    -Graph (creates a graph from nodes and edges)
