  # PythonScripts
The DataStructures.py file contains the following data structures with fully implemented functions, and test blocks at the end of the file:<br />
    	-DLink (creates arcs/edges/links between nodes) <br />
    	-Node (creates nodes/verticies)<br />
    	-Stack (standard LIFO stack)<br />
    	-FifoQueue (standard FIFO queue)<br />
    	-MinHeap (minimum heap class. uses an alternate implementation without the use of a decrease key function)<br />
    	-Graph (creates a graph from nodes and edges)<br />
		
See the class for more comments.  Still working on a few pieces (like generating a graph from file, etc...) <br />
<br />
<br />

The SearchAlgorithms.py file contains various searches to be carried out on an underlying Graph, even with cycles: <br />
		-Searcher (creates a searcher object to carry out the searches) <br />
				-DFSHelper (used for DFS recursion, which is much faster than traditional DFS)<br />
				-DepthFirstSearchRecursive (recursively searches a graph) <br />
				-DepthFirstSearchStack (searches a graph by stack implementation, needs work but works)<br />
				-BreadthFirstSearch (searches a graph by queue implementation)<br />
				-LowestCostFirstSearch (greedy algorithm, aka Dijkstras) <br />
				-Astar (greedy algorithm with heuristic)<br />
				-CalculateHeuristic (needs finished) <br />
				
see the class for more comments. Work in progress. <br />
